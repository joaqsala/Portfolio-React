                    Ny name is Joaquin. I'm a mathematics content specialist transitioning into the world of programming.

                    I recently completed an intensive coding bootcamp through the University of Texas at Austin where I acquired a diverse skill set in programming languages and methodologies.

                    I am actively seeking opportunities that allow me to merge my mathematical knowledge and programming skills. My strong analytical mindset and problem-solving abilities make me well-suited for collaborative environments that demand attention to detail.

                    Let's connect and discuss how we can make a positive impact together.</p>
